          <div><p>All the aforementioned general categories of data may contain data that by itself does not identify you and is therefore not deemed as personal data.</p></div>
          <div><p>Please try to avoid supplying any unnecessary personal data to us.</p></div>
          
          <h3 class="about__us__title">Information You Choose to Display Publicly on Our Services</h3>
          <div><p>Some users may elect to publicly post personally identifying or sensitive information about themselves in their normal use of our services. This could occur through the use of optional profile fields, in interactions on public boards, or if a previously private interaction is made public. Information like that, which is voluntarily posted in publicly visible parts of our services, is considered to be public, even if it would otherwise be considered to be personally identifying or sensitive. We may process such information posted by you for the performance of a contract between you and us and the legitimate interests of ours and/or those of third-parties, namely to provide our services, to prevent, detect and investigate fraud, criminal activity and/or other misuse of the services and compliance with a legal obligation that Xcrowme is subject to, namely in order to comply with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws. Additionally, voluntarily publicizing such information means that you lose any privacy rights you might normally have with regards to that information. It may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications, like spam.</p></div>
          <div><p>Please also remember that if you choose to provide personally identifiable information using certain public features of our services, individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through our services.</p></div>

          <div><p>Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6, we may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject to, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.</p></div>
          <h3 class="about__us__title">7. Your Rights</h3>
          <div><p>In this Section 7, we have summarized the principal rights that you have under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, might contain restrictions depending on the legal basis for processing the data and, to keep this policy as concise and easily accessible as possible, not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for further details of these rights.</p></div>
          <div><p>Your principal rights under the data protection law are:</p></div>
          <div><p>(a) the right to access;</p></div>
          <div><p>You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, to access the personal data. Providing that the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee. You can view and export your personal data under your account settings page.</p></div>

          <div><p>(f) the right to complain to a supervisory authority;</p></div>
          <div><p>If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection.

          <div><p>(g) the right to withdraw consent.</p></div>
          <div><p>To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.</p></div>
          <div><p>Without prejudice to the aforementioned, if we have reasonable doubts concerning the identity of a user exercising his/her rights referred to in Section 7.2 or if we otherwise deem it necessary due to security reasons, we may request the provision of additional information and otherwise use all reasonable measures necessary to confirm the identity of the user.</p></div>
          <div><p>You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by contacting our customer support. Concerning "Right to erasure" users are also able to request the deletion of their account through our site.

          <h3 class="about__us__title">Acceptable Use Policy</h3>
          <h5>Date of the latest revision: 20 December 2020.</h5>
          <h3 class="about__us__title">Introduction</h3>
          <div><p>This document lays out the conditions of acceptable use of Xcrowme’ services. Acting against these conditions might cause account’s permanent or temporary suspension of access to Xcrowme’ services partially or totally. This document is complementary but not a replacement to Xcrowme’ Terms of Service. In addition to the conditions included in this document, each user is responsible for following Xcrowme’ Terms of Service and all applicable legislation from their own jurisdiction while using Xcrowme’ services. If there are discrepancies between this document and Xcrowme’ Terms of Service, the Terms of Service supersedes this Policy.</p></div>
          
          <h3 class="about__us__title">Account usage and verification</h3>
          <div><p>Xcrowme’ accounts are personal and intransferible. An individual user account should be verified and operated only by the person who created it. Company accounts must be registered and verified through the company verification system. Selling or giving away Xcrowme’ user accounts is not allowed.</p></div>
          <div><p>In order to decrease the risk of money laundering and illicit use of the platform, Xcrowme does not provide service to companies associated with the following industries:</p></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>Initial Coin Offerings</li>
              <li>Weapons or defense manufacturers</li>
              <li>Casinos and gambling firms</li>
              <li>External certified accountants, approved accountants, tax specialist accountants, external tax advisors and company auditors</li>
              <li>Lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals</li>
              <li>Nonprofit, political and religious organizations</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          
          <h3 class="about__us__title">Advertising and Trading</h3>
          <div><p>Users who create ads in Xcrowme are able to define different Bitcoin pricings in their ads according to criteria such as payment method and customer groups. Advertisers are not allowed to use ad pricing for manipulating the market (e.g. attempting to force prices up or down) or make use of abusive margins in pricing equations. Acceptable pricing margins must take into account the ongoing practices of the targeted regional market. For example, if bank transfer ads in Nigeria have margins between 10-20% above or below market average, setting up an advertisement with 200% margin will be deemed as abusive pricing. It is not allowed to keep multiple active ads in the same payment method category for the same currency in the same country unless the ads in question have at least 3% price difference or target different customer groups (e.g. trade limits are different or there are new users restrictions).</p></div>
          <div><p>Xcrowme allows users to create ads for non-listed payment methods under the categories “Other Online Payment”, “Other Online Wallet” and “Other Remittance” accordingly. Xcrowme also allow advertising the following payment methods:</p></div>
