          <h5 class="sub__about__us__title">what is xcrowme.com?</h5>
          <div><p>Xcrowme is a peer-to-peer E-commodity exchange. We are a marketplace where users can buy and sell cryptocurrencies and e-commodities to and from each other. Users, called traders, create advertisements with the price and the payment method they want to offer. You can browse our website for trade advertisements and search for a payment method you prefer.

          <h5 class="sub__about__us__title">How do I buy or sell Bitcoins?</h5>
          <div><p>To help you get started with your first Bitcoin trade we've made two short guides to answer all your questions.Open support ticket Write us a tweet</p></div>
          <div><p>If you are looking to buy bitcoins please take a look at our how to buy Bitcoins guide.</p></div>
          <div><p>If you are looking to sell bitcoins please take a look at our how to sell Bitcoins guide.</p></div>
          
          <h5 class="sub__about__us__title">How am I protected from being scammed?</h5>
          <div><p>All online trades are protected by escrow. When a trade is started the amount of Bitcoins for the trade is automatically reserved from the seller's Xcrowme Wallet. This means that if the seller runs away with your money and does not release your Bitcoins Xcrowme.com support can release the Bitcoins to you from escrow. If you're selling Bitcoins, we would never release the escrow before we confirmed payment from the Bitcoin buyer.</p></div>
          
          <h5 class="sub__about__us__title">Can I buy less than one Bitcoin? How much does a Bitcoin cost?</h5>
          <div><p>Next to each advertisement on the website the price of a Bitcoin for that advertisement is shown as currency per Bitcoin. For example, if we are buying Bitcoin with the currency US dollars the price would be shown as 10420 USD / BTC. This means that if I wanted to buy 1 Bitcoin it would cost me 10420 US dollars.</p></div>
          
          <h5 class="sub__about__us__title">Can I buy less than 1 Bitcoin?</h5>
          <div><p>Absolutely! In each advertisement you see what's called limits. That shows you the least and the most amount of Bitcoins that you can buy from that advertisement.One Bitcoin can be divided into much much smaller pieces, the smallest piece is called one satoshi and is the same as 0.00000001 BTC.</p></div>
          
          <h5 class="sub__about__us__title">Why is it so expensive to buy with PayPal? or Credit card? Why are some payment methods cheaper?</h5>
          <div><p>One of the best features of Bitcoin is that it gives you control over your money, but it's also this feature that makes it very different from traditional money. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible; most traditional payment methods can be charged back. This creates risk for the person selling the Bitcoins, as PayPal or a bank can take the money someone paid him out of his account after he has sent away the Bitcoins. That is why traders need to have a high price for certain payment methods, to protect themselves against this risk.</p></div>
          <div><p>That is why we recommend for you to get the best price to pay using a hard to reverse payment method, such as Cash Deposit, bank transfers and mobile payments (Like Opay in Nigeria). When you search to buy Bitcoins, select All online offers as a payment method and you will see offers for all payment methods and you can choose one that is convenient for you and offers a better price.</p></div>
          
          <h5 class="sub__about__us__title">What happens when I pay, and the seller doesn't give me my Bitcoins? </h5>
          <div><p>All our online trades are protected with escrow to prevent this from happening. When the trade is started, the Bitcoin amount for the trade is taken from the sellers wallet and is held by Xcrowme for the entire time of the trade. If the seller is trying to scam you, it's easy for you to open a dispute on the trade and our support staff will contact you to ask for proof that you have paid and then give the Bitcoins to you.</p></div>
          
          <h5 class="sub__about__us__title">How do I send Bitcoins and how can I pay with Bitcoins after buying them?</h5>
          <div><p>If you purchase Bitcoins using Xcrowme.com, the Bitcoins will appear in your Xcrowme Wallet. From there you can easily send the Bitcoins to other Bitcoin addresses. The vast majority Bitcoin services are compatible with each other, the same Bitcoins you buy from Xcrowme will work in your favorite online stores that accept Bitcoin, and also in local shops that accept Bitcoin.</p></div>
          <div><p>Please note that your Xcrowme Wallet cannot be used in a few specific situations. For example, you cannot use it with sites like satoshidice that returns Bitcoins to the sending address. Also newly generated Bitcoins from mining cannot be sent to your Xcrowme Wallet.</p></div>
          
          <h5 class="sub__about__us__title">How do I receive Bitcoins to my Xcrowme Wallet?</h5>
          <div><p>In order to sell Bitcoins on Xcrowme.com you'll first need to send some Bitcoins to your Xcrowme Wallet. To do that you'll need a Xcrowme.com account, access to Bitcoins in another Bitcoin wallet and you need to know your Xcrowme.com receiving address.</p></div>
          <div><p>In order to sell Bitcoins on Xcrowme.com you'll first need to send some Bitcoins to your Xcrowme Wallet. To do that you'll need a Xcrowme.com account, access to Bitcoins in another Bitcoin wallet and you need to know your Xcrowme.com receiving address.</p></div>
          <div><p>To find your Xcrowme.com receiving address you need to go to visit the Wallet page and click the Receive Bitcoins button.</p></div>
          <div><p>At the top of the page you'll find your receiving address. Please note that your receiving address changes after each transaction. We do this to protect your privacy. Your old receiving addresses will eventually expire. The expiring time for receiving addresses is 12 months.</p></div>
          <div><p>Once you have your Xcrowme.com receiving address, you can go to your other Bitcoin wallet and use this address to send Bitcoins to your Xcrowme.com address.</p></div>

          <h5 class="sub__about__us__title">How long does it take to send or receive Bitcoins using my Xcrowme Wallet?</h5>
          <div><p>If all goes well Bitcoin transactions sent with the correct fee take between 10-60 minutes when you are sending Bitcoins to your Xcrowme Wallet. If your transaction is taking longer than this, please check that the fee is correct.</p></div>
          <div><p>Transactions between Xcrowme users are instantaneous.</p></div>
          <div><p>Transactions you send from your Xcrowme wallet are sent with a high priority fee to ensure they confirm within approximately 30 minutes (within the next three blocks).</p></div>
          <div><p>I've waited 60 minutes and my transaction is still pending, now what? Your Bitcoin transaction was most likely sent with a fee that's too low or the Bitcoin network might be experiencing congestion, in this case transactions will take much longer to go through.</p></div>
          <div><p>Bitcoin transactions have to be confirmed by the Bitcoin network before they are usable from the wallet they are sent to. You can read more about confirmations on the Bitcoin wikipedia.</p></div>
          
          <h5 class="sub__about__us__title">To check the status of your Bitcoin transaction</h5>
          <div>
            <ol>

On Xcrowme.com you can get the transaction information from your wallet transaction history page after you have sent the transaction.</li>
              <li>Go to Tradeblock.com.</li>
              <li>Type in the receiving address or the transactions ID (TXID) into the Search field. Use the Bitcoin amount to quickly identify transactions if the receiving address has several transactions incoming.</li>

              <li>Look for where it shows you how many confirmations the transaction has.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          
          <div><p>If your transaction has...</p></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>...more than six confirmations: the receiving wallet has received the transaction. Please contact the provider of the wallet if the transaction still does not appear in the receiving wallet.</li>
              <li>...0-6 confirmations or unconfirmed: the transaction has left the sending wallet and is still under way.</li>
              <li>...you cannot find the transaction: the transaction never left from the sending wallet. Contact the provider of the sending wallet.</li>
